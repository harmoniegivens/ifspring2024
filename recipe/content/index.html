    <h1>Mayak Eggs Recipe Research</h1>
    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Mayak Eggs aka "Mayak Gyeran" (마약계란) is the Korean name for these Korean soy sauce jammy eggs. The literal translation in Korean is "drug eggs", thanks to their addictive flavors! Rest assured, there are no actual drugs in these eggs. The sweet and savory marinade is what gives these Korean mayak eggs their distinct taste. When we combine soy sauce with water, honey, and a variety of aromatics, it creates an unbelievably mouth-watering egg dish in Asian cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p><ol type="1"><li>Bring a small pot of water to boil on high heat. Add salt and vinegar. Gently lower eggs. Boil for 6 mins if you're using room temperature eggs or 7 minutes if they're cold eggs, uncovered. For hard boiled eggs, boil for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare a large bowl with enough water and ice cubes.</li>
        <li>Remove the eggs from boiling water. Transfer to ice-water bath to cool down completely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile in a container, combine Marinade ingredients as listed and mix well. Ensure the honey or sugar dissolves fully.</li>
        <li>Gently peel cooled eggs (Tip: crack the eggs with the back of the spoon and use spoon to help me lift off the shell starting at the bottom of the egg where there is a gap between the egg and shell). Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place eggs into marinade. (Tip: Place clean paper towel or plastic wrap on top of the eggs to push them deeper into the marinade for a more even brown color.) Cover container with lid and let this rest in the fridge for at least 5 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Enjoy over rice with suggested garnishes.</li></ol>
