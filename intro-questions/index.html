        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <p><ol type="1">
            <b><li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc)</li></b>
            <p>My name is Harmonie. I'm a junior CommDes major with a minor in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
            <b><li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li></b>
            <p>My background is mainly in design (Adobe Creative Suite) but I did take CSE 131. I'm taking this class because it is a major requirement.</p>
            <b><li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li></b>
            <p>I used HTML very briefly at the end of Type I, but it was an <b>extremely</b> basic implementation.</p>
            <b><li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li></b>
            <p>I hope to learn how to use these coding languages to design. My current method of designing is a lot more straight forward. I want to leave this class able to create a funtioning webpage.</p>
            <b><li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li></b>
            <p>I assume the interactive aspect is a lot different. Often designing for paper, you have only one view/path for the user to take. Whereas designing for the screen, you should be able to create/anticipate a user journey effectively.</p>
            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p><a href="https://xaviercusso.com/#/">Xavier Cusso</a> The website effectively uses color and is very well organized with a good balance of type hierarchy and image usage.</p>
            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p><a href="https://pitchfork.com/">Pitchfork</a> This website is very legible and unencumbered by crazy colors and visuals. It's very straightforward and has good hierarchy.</p>
            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p><a href="https://wearecocoon.co.uk/">Cocoon</a> I think this one is good because it uses an interesting color theme and scale while also communicating very well. It is the happy medium between the other two examples.</p>
